    <h2>Project Objective</h2>
    <p>The goal of this assignment is to design and build a basic 3-page website using WordPress. The process includes planning using Figma, selecting an appropriate theme, customizing content, and deploying the site.</p>

    <h2>Theme Justification</h2>
    <p><strong>Chosen Theme:</strong> Astra</p>
    <p>I selected the Astra theme because it's lightweight, fast-loading, and easy to customize. It works well with Elementor and offers responsive designs. For a personal portfolio scenario, Astra provides the perfect structure to showcase my work and contact information in a professional and clear format.</p>
